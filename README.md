<p>
This small command line program uses 2 of the NirCMD application to run my startup configs for my pc when I start work. 
</p>
<p>
This application requires Python3.6 or above and the dependancies in the requirements.txt
</p>
<p>
This is a personal project due to me being lazy in the mornings but please feel free to clone and edit to your own, this is unlisenced and any damages done is a result of a misuse of this software.
